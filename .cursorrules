MANDATORY: Always reference the nuxt-4-development-guide.md file when answering Nuxt-related questions or making implementations.

CRITICAL PROCESS:
1. VERIFY directory structure against the "App Directory Structure" section (lines 50-64)
2. CONFIRM component placement is under app/components/ not root components/
3. DOUBLE-CHECK auto-import patterns match the guide exactly

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE VERIFICATION:
- Components MUST be in app/components/ (NOT root components/)
- Pages MUST be in app/pages/ (NOT root pages/)
- Auto-import references use ~/components/ alias (which resolves to app/components/)
- Physical structure: app/components/ | Import alias: ~/components/
- Always cross-reference with guide before suggesting directory changes
- NEVER assume - always search the guide for exact patterns
