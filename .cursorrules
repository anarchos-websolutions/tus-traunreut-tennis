MANDATORY: Always reference the nuxt-4-development-guide.md file when answering Nuxt-related questions or making implementations.

CRITICAL PROCESS:
1. BEFORE any Nuxt implementation, search the guide for the specific topic
2. VERIFY directory structure against the "App Directory Structure" section (lines 50-64)
3. CONFIRM component placement is under app/components/ not root components/
4. DOUBLE-CHECK auto-import patterns match the guide exactly
5. FOR UI/COMPONENT work, ALSO reference docs/nuxt-ui-comprehensive-guide.md
6. NEVER rely on general Nuxt knowledge - only use what's documented in the guides

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE VERIFICATION:
- Components MUST be in app/components/ (NOT root components/)
- Pages MUST be in app/pages/ (NOT root pages/)
- Auto-import references use ~/components/ alias (which resolves to app/components/)
- Physical structure: app/components/ | Import alias: ~/components/
- Always cross-reference with guide before suggesting directory changes
- NEVER assume - always search the guide for exact patterns

UI/COMPONENT IMPLEMENTATION RULES:
- For Nuxt UI components, ALWAYS consult docs/nuxt-ui-comprehensive-guide.md first
- Use proper UApp wrapper in app.vue for Nuxt UI components
- Follow Nuxt UI theming patterns (slots, variants, colors)
- Import CSS correctly: @import "tailwindcss"; @import "@nuxt/ui";
- Use Nuxt UI composables (useToast, useColorMode, etc.) when available
- Verify component props, slots, and emits against the comprehensive guide
- Follow Nuxt UI form patterns with UForm for validation

TYPOGRAPHY RULES:
- ALWAYS use custom typography classes from docs/typography-guide.md
- Use .title, .title-lg, .title-xl for headings (professional dark grey)
- Use .text-body, .text-body-lg, .text-body-sm for content (readable grey)
- Use .text-muted for secondary info, .text-accent for emphasis
- NEVER use green/orange colors for body text - only for accents
- Keep tennis colors for buttons, icons, and highlights only

Key documentation is available in:
- docs/nuxt-4-development-guide.md (comprehensive Nuxt 4 guide) - ALWAYS SEARCH THIS FIRST
- docs/nuxt-ui-comprehensive-guide.md (comprehensive Nuxt UI v4 guide) - SEARCH FOR UI/COMPONENT WORK
- docs/typography-guide.md (custom typography classes) - REFERENCE FOR ALL TEXT STYLING
