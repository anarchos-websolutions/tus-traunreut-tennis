MANDATORY: Always reference the nuxt-4-development-guide.md file when answering Nuxt-related questions or making implementations.

CRITICAL PROCESS:
1. BEFORE any Nuxt implementation, search the guide for the specific topic
2. VERIFY directory structure against the "App Directory Structure" section (lines 50-64)
3. CONFIRM component placement is under app/components/ not root components/
4. DOUBLE-CHECK auto-import patterns match the guide exactly
5. NEVER rely on general Nuxt knowledge - only use what's documented in the guide

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE VERIFICATION:
- Components MUST be in app/components/ (NOT root components/)
- Pages MUST be in app/pages/ (NOT root pages/)
- Auto-import references use ~/components/ alias (which resolves to app/components/)
- Physical structure: app/components/ | Import alias: ~/components/
- Always cross-reference with guide before suggesting directory changes
- NEVER assume - always search the guide for exact patterns

Key documentation is available in:
- nuxt-4-development-guide.md (comprehensive Nuxt 4 guide) - ALWAYS SEARCH THIS FIRST
